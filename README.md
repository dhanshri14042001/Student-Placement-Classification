# Student_Placement_Classification

This project predicts whether a student will get placed based on their academic and aptitude features such as CGPA and IQ.
It uses Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) to classify students into placed (1) or not placed (0).

#Project Overview :
A simple machine learning classification project
Uses a CSV dataset containing student information
Features: cgpa, iq
Target: placement (0 = Not Placed, 1 = Placed)
Data preprocessing includes:
Handling missing values
Dropping unused columns
Scaling using StandardScaler
Model trained using Logistic Regression
Visualized results using matplotlib

#Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a simple and effective machine learning pipeline for binary classification.
It is ideal for beginners who want to understand how ML models work in real-life scenarios.
